# How to Contribute

The contribution guideline is derived from the Conventional Commits contribution
guideline

## Contributor Behavior

Be kind to one another.

tl;dr: we value constructive interaction.

## Pull Requests

We use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main
versioning workflow. Contributions are welcome via GitHub pull requests. This
guide may help you getting started:

https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **main** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate
feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch.

This allows us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests SHOULD adhere to the
[Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
